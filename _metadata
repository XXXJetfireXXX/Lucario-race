Take control of the famous Aura Jackal as a Playable Race.[/h1]\n[b]==========================================================================[/b]\n\nThe Lucario race is an old race mod, created back in the days of the Koala betas. For years this mod has been avaliable for many to enjoy. Although ever since 1.0, the steam workshop launched. Now the Lucario Race is avaliable for everyone to use easily via steam workshop.\n\nThe lucario race is a mod inspired by a fictional species, Lucario, belonging to Game Freak, Pokemon, and the concept creator Ken Sugimori. This is a fan mod, attempting to add the race to Starbound. All artwork in this mod was crafted by dedicated fans and developers. It has been re-created without the use of original material, visually. The mod tries to make the lucario mesh into the Starbound universe and is constantly building to try to integrate into the lore.\n\nIn no way does this mod incorporate features of the Pokemon games, but instead tries to make the lucario in a way that fits Starbound.\n[quote][h1]This mod was originally created by Ochiru Yuki:[/h1]\n[url=http://community.playstarbound.com/members/ochiru-yuki.257329/]Ochiru Yuki on the Official Starbound Forums[/url]\nI have the grace and green light of the Original Author to bring this mod to you.\n[/quote]\n\n[h1]Frackin' Races Compatibility[/h1]\n[b]==========================================================================[/b]\nThis mod is compatible with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=763259329]Frackin' Races[/url]. Although no worries, the code for Frackin' Races is not in this mod but the Frakin' Races mod itself. This mod is highly suggested by many as it gives each race their own perks.\n[quote][h1]For Information on Frackin' Races Compatibility and to report bugs of issues with the Lucario and Frackin' Races, Visit here:[/h1]\n[list][*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1356955138/3288067088095861985/]Lucario FrackinRaces Mod Compatibility[/url][/list][/quote]\n\n[h1]Wardrobe Interface Compatibility[/h1]\n[b]==========================================================================[/b]\nThanks to\n[quote][h1]Silverfeelin[/h1]\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/Silverfeelin[/quote]\nThe Lucario race has been given a significant upgrade, which only gives you the correct armor recipes for your body type at start. This means that in return, the Lucario Race is FULLY compatible with the Wardrobe mod series. You do not require a third mod to make this species compatible as it is built into the Lucario Race itself. Although if you don't want to use the Wardrobe Interface mod series, you don't have to. The lucario race runs fine without it.\n[quote][h1]Although if you don't have Wardrobe Interface and want to try it out, check it out HERE!![/h1]\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=734855062[/quote]\n\n[h1]Species[/h1]\n[b]==========================================================================[/b]\nThis mod adds the lucario species to your game with over 60,000,000 different posssible outcomes in character creation. This mod is the first to incorporate multiple body types and a neutral option without the use of seperate mods. By changing colors you can access tons of possibilities for your unique lucario. The options you have now are insane, it is questionable if more choices will be added in the future or not.\n[quote][h1]For information on character creation, body types, or how this has so many possibilities, go here:[/h1]\n[list][*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1356955138/1743352529775560699/]Character Creation[/url][/list][/quote]\n\n[h1]Items and Objects[/h1]\n[b]==========================================================================[/b]\nThe Lucario Race adds in new items. These range from new swords to crafting materials. More items will come with updates. Most of these items will be avaliable to the lucario solely, although some are for every race to be able to spawn lucario NPCs.\n[quote][h1]For information on items and objects, check here:[/h1]\n[list][*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1356955138/1743352529775729738/]Item List[/url][/list][/quote]\n\n[h1]For Information about NPCs, look here:[/h1]\n[b]==========================================================================[/b]\n[quote][list][*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1356955138/1743352529775804767/]NPC Tenants, guards, etc Information[/url][/list][/quote]\n\n[h1]Bug Reporting[/h1]\n[b]==========================================================================[/b]\nThis is a mod after all and ChuckleFish updates Starbound every once in a while.
